## Abstract
Even though Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are one of the most used models in machine learning,they are still too often treated as “black box” tools without a complete understanding of why some NNarchitectures work better than others. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of the ShapleyValue in machine learning. While past approaches mainly target model interpretability and featureselection, we explore an orthogonal direction: we propose a method for measuring the contribution ofsingle components to the performance of a neural network. By treating such components as playersin a cooperative game, we can evaluate their utility by measuring the model’s accuracy. We find thatour results are consistent and coherent with common empirical findings in machine learning.
